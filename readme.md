## Description

A dashboard is a very popular feature for Discord bots users as it allows them to access and modify their server's settings quickly and easily. It usually takes the form of a web page that presents the bot and its features. Unfortunately it's a difficult concept to understand for beginners (and even for more advanced developers!), so this module allows you to add in just a few lines a customizable dashboard to any bot!

## Installation

```js
npm install discord-easy-dashboard
```

## Documentation

To quickly understand how to use the module, you can read [Getting Started](/docs/gettingStarted.md).
